# The equation for F1 Macro Score is (2 * Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
# Where Precision is the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions
# and Recall is the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of actual relevant documents

# The difference between F1 Macro and F1 Micro Score is that F1 Micro Score is calculated for each class
# whereas F1 Macro Score is calculated for all classes.

# You can compute the F1 Macro Score by averaging the F1 scores for each class.


# The difference between average and single linkage in agglomerative clustering is that
# average linkage uses the average of the distances of each observation from its cluster,
# while single linkage uses the minimum of the distances of each observation from its cluster.


# df.iloc is used to access the dataframe by index.
# df.iloc[0] is the first row of the dataframe.
# df.iloc[0] = 10 will set the first row to 10.
